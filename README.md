# coolspy3-gradescope-calendar
This project is the web continuation of [CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar](https://gihtub.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar). It is a web app that allows you to import your Gradescope calendar into your Google Calendar.

Originally, I was planning to wait until this project was finished before putting it on GitHub, but I plan to be on vacation for a few days, so I decided to put it up now so that I can work on it while I'm away if I have time. The code should be fairly close to the final state. At this point, I just have to finish writing some documentation before I can deploy it.
