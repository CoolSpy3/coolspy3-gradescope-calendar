            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <p>
                This is the frontend of a <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar">Python script</a> I wrote to put my Gradescope Assignments
                onto my Google Calendar. TODO: EXPLAIN TAGS IN CALENDAR description and TIMEZONES

            <h2>The formatting is terrible! How do you expect anyone to use it?</h2>
            <p>
                Of all my skills, web design is not the best. This app is designed to be functional, not pretty.
                If you want to help redesign it, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar-web/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I know this is a legit site?</h2>
            <p>
                All of the source code for this website is available on <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar-web/">GitHub</a>.
                I've also done my best to document the code and put descriptions of how data is used <a href="/privacy-policy">on this website</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I use this website?</h2>
            <p>
                Click the <a href="/login">Signup / Login</a> button here or at the top of the page, and follow the instructions to link your Google and Gradescope accounts.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I remove this website's access to my accounts?</h2>
            <p>
                On your <a href="/dashboard">Account Dashboard</a>, click the button labeled <a href="/delete-my-account">Delete My Account</a> (or just click this link),
                and you will be redirected to a page that will remove your account and all associated information from this website.
                You will also be given instructions on how to de-authorize this website from your Google and Gradescope accounts.
                TODO MOVE TEXT:
                Go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a> and remove the "Gradescope Calendar" app.

            <h2>How are you making money/paying for this site?</h2>
            <p>
                I am making great use of Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing">free usage limits</a>.
                The remaining usage rates are low enough that I've set a $1 price cap on the remaining usage (so please don't DDoS me).
                If this site becomes popular, I will probably add a donation button to cover the hosting costs.
                Ultimately, I plan to use this site myself, and I heard that others might be interested in the same service without the
                hassle of <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar">the standalone version</a>.
                For the forseeable future, this will remain a free service. If it exceeds the usage cap, then it will be shut down until the next month.
                Conversely, if this service goes mostly unused, I may decide to shut it down and/or stop maintaining it.
