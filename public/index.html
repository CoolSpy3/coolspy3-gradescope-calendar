            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <p>
                This is the frontend of a <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar">Python script</a> I wrote to put my Gradescope Assignments
                onto my Google Calendar (with some improvements).
            </p>
            <h2>The formatting is terrible! How do you expect anyone to use it?</h2>
            <p>
                This app is designed to be functional, not pretty (css is for nerds).
                If you want to redesign it, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Does this site support calendar apps other than Google Calendar?</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, no. I agree that the best way to implement this would be to provide a subscribable calendar link, however,
                this service is closely integrated with Google Calendar, so adding support for other services would require
                a decent amount of work. Also, implementing the service with a specific calendar in mind gives me more control over the
                amount of backend processing required (so the service doesn't exceed the usage cap) while letting me more directly support
                Google Calendar features. Based on interest and my availability, I may implement support for other calendar systems in the future.

            <h2>How do I use this website?</h2>
            <p>
                Click the "Sign in with Google" button at the top of the page, and follow the instructions to link your Google and Gradescope accounts.

                For more information, check out our <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/wiki/">documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I remove this website's access to my accounts?</h2>
            <p>
                To remove authorization from your Google Account, go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>
                and remove the "Gradescope Calendar" app.

                To remove authorization from your Gradescope Account, you may delete your account on your account dashboard.
                This will invalidate your Gradescope token and remove your account from our database. Alternatively,
                if you extracted a Gradescope token from your browser (and the session is still open), logging out of
                your Gradescope account will invalidate the token. It's possible that changing your Gradescope password
                will also invalidate the token, but I have not tested this.

                If you delete your account, all tokens associated with your account will be invalidated.

            <h2>How are you making money/paying for this site?</h2>
            <p>
                I am making great use of Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing">free usage limits</a>.
                The remaining usage rates are low enough that I've set a $1 price cap on the remaining usage.
                If this site becomes popular, I will probably add a donation button to cover the hosting costs.
                Ultimately, I plan to use this site myself, and I heard that others might be interested in the same service without the
                hassle of <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar">the standalone version</a>.
                For the foreseeable future, this will remain a free service. If it exceeds the usage cap, then it will be shut down until the next month.
                Conversely, if this service goes mostly unused, I may decide to shut it down and/or stop maintaining it.
