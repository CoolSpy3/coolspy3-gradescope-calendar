            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <p>
                This is the frontend of a <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar">Python script</a> I wrote to put my Gradescope Assignments
                onto my Google Calendar.
            </p>
            <h2>The formatting is terrible! How do you expect anyone to use it?</h2>
            <p>
                Of all my skills, web design is not the best. This app is designed to be functional, not pretty.
                If you want to help redesign it, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.

            <h2>How do I know this is a legit site?</h2>
            <p>
                All the source code for this website is available on <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/">GitHub</a>.
                I've also done my best to document the code and put descriptions of how data is used <a href="/privacy-policy">on this website</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I use this website?</h2>
            <p>
                Click the <a href="/login">Signup / Login</a> button here or at the top of the page, and follow the instructions to link your Google and Gradescope accounts.

                For more information, check out our <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/wiki/">documentation</a>.

            <h2>How do I remove this website's access to my accounts?</h2>
            <p>
                To remove authorization from your Google Account, go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>
                and remove the "Gradescope Calendar" app.

                To remove authorization from your Gradescope Account, you may delete your account on your account dashboard.
                This will invalidate your Gradescope token and remove your account from our database. Alternatively,
                if you extracted a Gradescope token from your browser, logging out of your Gradescope account will invalidate the token.
                It's possible that changing your Gradescope password will also invalidate the token, but I have not tested this.
            </p>

            <h2>How are you making money/paying for this site?</h2>
            <p>
                I am making great use of Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing">free usage limits</a>.
                The remaining usage rates are low enough that I've set a $1 price cap on the remaining usage (so please don't DDoS me).
                If this site becomes popular, I will probably add a donation button to cover the hosting costs.
                Ultimately, I plan to use this site myself, and I heard that others might be interested in the same service without the
                hassle of <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/gradescope-calendar">the standalone version</a>.
                For the foreseeable future, this will remain a free service. If it exceeds the usage cap, then it will be shut down until the next month.
                Conversely, if this service goes mostly unused, I may decide to shut it down and/or stop maintaining it.
            </p>
