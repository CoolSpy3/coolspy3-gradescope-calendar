            <h1>Privacy Policy / Terms of Use</h1>
            I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not going to write a massive wall of text that no one will read.
            However, this is still a binding TOS. By using this app, you agree to follow the terms laid out below.
            We may update this TOS at any time. Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the new TOS.
            If any part of this TOS is found to be unenforceable, the rest of the TOS will remain in effect.
            Here's the important parts:
            <h2>What data we collect and why</h2>
            <p>
                We collect:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A token to access your Google Calendar - To add assignments from Gradescope</li>
                <li>Your Gradescope credentials/token - To access Gradescope on your behalf and download your assignments</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
            <p>
                We keep your data until you delete your account. If you delete your account, we will delete all of your data from our servers.
                It will be like you never signed up. If this service becomes really popular, we may delete old/inactive accounts to save space.
                This will not affect accounts which still have new assignments coming in on Gradescope.
                Additionally, if your account is deleted, this service should be simple enough that recreating it is not a huge hassle.
                We may also delete and/or blacklist your account if we determine that you are abusing the service.
            </p>
            <h2>I want to delete or download my data</h2>
            <p>
                There are buttons for this on the <a href="/dashboard">Account Dashboard</a>. For your security, some information you provide
                (ex. your Google and Gradescope Credentials) is not accessible from the frontend and will not be included in your data download.
                It will still be deleted upon account deletion.
            </p>
            <h2>How we store your data</h2>
            <p>
                All data on this site is stored on Google Firebase which is configured with security rules to prevent unauthorized access.
                This basically means enforcing the rule: <code>user data can only be accessed by the user and the system backend</code>.

                For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/wiki/2.-How-the-site-works#how-is-data-stored">How is data stored?</a> section of our wiki.
            </p>
            <h2>A note about cookies</h2>
            <p>
                This app is hosted on Google Firebase. The only data we store on your device is a temporary token to access your Google Calendar.
                Additionally, Firebase uses cookies for authentication and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/manage-cookies">other purposes</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Your obligations to us</h2>
            <p>
                Please read the <a href="/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> before using the app.
                This app is meant as a helpful tool for students. Please do not abuse it. This should be self-explanatory,
                but here are some helpful guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't spam requests to the server (This will just trigger the data cap and ruin it for everyone)</li>
                <li>Don't pass in malformed or otherwise intentionally incorrect data (If anything it will probably just mess up your own account)</li>
                <li>Don't try to run code that accesses the live site or pentest against the actual site. If you want to test the site's code, read our
                    <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guidelines</a>.</li>
                <li>Don't try to hack our server or steal other people's data (If you think you've found a vulnerability, <a href="https://github.com/CoolSpy3/coolspy3-gradescope-calendar/security/advisories/new">report it here</a>)</li>
                <li>Don't do anything illegal</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A note about Gradescope</h2>
            <p>
                Gradescope does not provide a public API. As such, this service works by logging into Gradescope on your behalf and scraping the data.
                I don't think this is against Gradescope TOS (I'm not a lawyer and the TOS is not very clear on this).
                You agree that use of this app is at your own risk, and grant this app permission to access your Gradescope account on your behalf.
            </p>
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                We assert that we have made a good faith effort to make this app secure and reliable.
                However, we cannot guarantee that it will always work. By using this app, you agree to
                hold us harmless for any damages caused by this app. This includes but not limited to damages caused by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Service interruptions</li>
                <li>Data breaches</li>
                <li>Loss of access to the app</li>
                <li>Shutdown of the app</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Other Licenses and Policies</h2>
            <p>
                This app is built on Google Firebase.
                Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a> and
